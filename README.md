### The Draft Genome of Lactococcus lactis str. PrHT3

### Process/Pipeline

General Description is on the **[Project](/project.md)** page.

These data were submitted to NCBI and used the [INSDC standards for genome assembly submission](https://www.insdc.org/insdc-standards-genome-assembly-submission).

The bioinformatics of this project will be placed in [Metadata](/metadata.md), and we provide a project-specific [bash script](/files/lactoscript-only.sh) for reproducibility. The use of the CheckM software to validate the species is within the [Validate](/checkm.md) page which includes the brief set of commands to generate the phylogenetic tree and statistics.

We are grateful to the authors of the sofware used. [Citations and acknowledgements](/citations.md)
