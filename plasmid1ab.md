## Plasmid-1ab

We were unable to resolve whether the high-copy-number plasmid was one plasmid or two plasmids (described below). After assembly, the total length of the submitted contigs was **17,155 bp**. These SPAdes-derived plasmid sequences were extensively used for searching the NCBI databases. Only three regions of 5,230 bp, 1,088 bp, and 608 bp were found as conserved contiguous sequence elements on different assemblies. These sequence elements were also assembled as part of the *L. lactis* genome. Functional annotation of proteins is beyond the scope of this initial genome announcement but genes associated with pathogenicity were represented on Plasmid 1(ab). Because the re-assembled plasmid contigs did not appear as contiguous 
sequences when using Blast+ on the NCBI "nt" database (homologies that 
appeared were fragmented) the plasmid was submitted as assembled contigs rather than a
`.BAM` file. When using 4-million paired end reads, the mean read depth of plasmid-1ab nodes is 381x, while the genome nodes read depth is 54x. This suggests a plasmid copy number of over 7 per cell.

NOTE: In all the images below read depth is ***relative*** and colored with "red" for higher read depth, and a darker color indicating lower read depths. We removed reads below **25x** as putative artifacts.

Using Bandage software, the `.gfa` graph generated by SPAdes appears as contiguous paths having seven (7) bubbles to resolve, suggesting two plasmids with shared sequence identity.

For this high-copy-number plasmid, the `.gfa` shared 
nodes cannot be split confidently to derive a linear path. With no other options for 
read-mapping, graph simplification, or node splitting, the contiguous nodes were merged 
resulting in a final graph (shared nodes are labeled).

Because these structural 
probabilities are unresolvable, the term "Plasmid-1ab" was used. 
We believe this plasmid (or plasmids) 
is "novel", *i.e.* only partially described previously.
