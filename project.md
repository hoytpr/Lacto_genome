# Project Description

## Abstract

We report here the draft genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis PrHT3 strain, isolated from organic basil. This strain possesses one chromosome and two plasmids. This strain possesses potential probiotic characteristics. 

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are found in variety of different environments including plant materials and animals1. Health benefit imparted by LAB with probiotic characteristics include antibacterial activity against pathogens, causing improvement in lactose metabolism, anti-mutagenic properties, anti-carcinogenic properties, reduction in serum cholesterol, anti-diarrheal properties, immune system stimulation, improvement in inflammatory bowel disease and suppression of Helicobacter pylori infection2,3 & 4. Food and Beverage market research reports estimate probiotic market size by revenue to reach 69 billion USD by 20235. We report here the draft genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis strain isolated from organic basil.
